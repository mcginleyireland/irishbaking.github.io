	<h1>About</h1>

<p>I love baking but sometimes I spend way too much time trying to find that one recipe
that I know 100% works and tastes amazing.
<br>
If you change one ingredient each recipe has different tips and tricks where you might need more flour or less sugar.
<br>
Now that I have this webiste I can share with the world my recipes and any little pockets of information I've learned on the way.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy discovering new recipes as much as I have baking them.</p>
