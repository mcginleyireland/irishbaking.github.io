    **Cupcakes**

    1. Heat the oven to 160째C (320째F). Grease and line a cupcake tin, or add cupcake liners.
    2. In a mizing bowl, cream the sugar and butter.
    3. Add in the 2 eggs.
    4. Add the vanilla extract.
    5. Add in the flour gradually.
    6. Evenly add the mixture to the your cupcake tin. (I used two spoons or an icecream scoop with a regular spoon)

    **Bake**

    1. Bake for 10-15 mins at 160째C (320째F).
    2. Let it cool for 10-20 mins and place it on a wire rack to cool more.

    **Buttercream Icing**

    1. Beat the butter for 3-5 minutes. (Make sure the butter is soft to squeeze, if it looks oily pop it in the fridge for 5 minutes) (It's more white because we've added air to it when beating the butter)
    2. Sift the icing sugar add in the half icing sugar when the butter looks a bit more white. Beat for 3-5 minutes. (Medium to high)
    3. Add in the second half of the icing sugar. Again, beat for 3-5 minutes. (Medium to high)
    4. At this stage it should be pretty smooth but also stiff at the same time.
    5. Add in the vanilla extract.
    6. Add in the milk gradually. (Not all may be needed)
    7. If it still looks wet, you can add a small bit more of icing sugar.
    8. You'll know it's done when you pull away your whisk and it brings some of the buttercream with it.
    9. Move half of the mixture to a bowl and add the black food colouring. (Or any other you'd like)
    10. Move the other half of the mixture to a bowl and add the orange food colouring. (Or any other you'd like)
    11. In a piping bag add your large star piece but any design can work.
    12. Add the black icing to one side of the piping bag and the orange icing to the other side of the piping bag.
    13. Then pipe along the edges of the cupcake first and in a circular motion work your way into the middle.
    14. Decorate to make it more halloweenie! I added Cats and Spiders I got in the baking shop.
