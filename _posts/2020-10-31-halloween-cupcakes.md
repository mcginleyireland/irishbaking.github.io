    **Cupcakes**

    1. Heat the oven to 160째C (320째F). Grease and line a cupcake tin, or add cupcake liners.
    2. In a mizing bowl, cream the sugar and butter.
    3. Add in the 2 eggs.
    4. Add the vanilla extract.
    5. Add in the flour gradually.
    6. Evenly add the mixture to the your cupcake tin. (I used two spoons or an icecream scoop with a regular spoon)

    **Bake**

    1. Bake for 10-15 mins at 160째C (320째F).
    2. Let it cool for 10-20 mins and place it on a wire rack to cool more.

    **Buttercream Icing**

    1. Beat the butter for 3-5 minutes. (Make sure the butter is soft to squeeze, if it looks oily pop it in the fridge for 5 minutes) (It's more white because we've added air to it when beating the butter)
    2. Sift the icing sugar add in the half icing sugar when the butter looks a bit more white. Beat for 3-5 minutes. (Medium to high)
    3. Add in the second half of the icing sugar. Again, beat for 3-5 minutes. (Medium to high)
    4. At this stage it should be pretty smooth but also stiff at the same time.
    5. Add in the vanilla extract.
    6. Add in the milk gradually. (Not all may be needed)
    7. If it still looks wet, you can add a small bit more of icing sugar.
    8. You'll know it's done when you pull away your whisk and it brings some of the buttercream with it.
    9. Move half of the mixture to a bowl and add the black food colouring. (Or any other you'd like)
    10. Move the other half of the mixture to a bowl and add the orange food colouring. (Or any other you'd like)
    11.

Cholocate Oil Cake. This is something that was made for my Birthday and honestly, I've only good memories attached to this cake.

Starting off with melting the butter with the oil and water.

Adding the cocoa powder.

Adding in the sugar, flour, baking soda, milk, eggs and vanila extract.

I used seprate tins for this cake but if you use butter/oil to grease the sides you can use one tin and slice in half later on.

Making the ganache was not as easy as I'd hoped. Next time will deffo just use melted chocolate.

Heat the double cream in a bain marie.

When the cream was slightly simmering I added in the chocolate.

I coated the first cake with ganache on wire rack and then added the second cake on top.
