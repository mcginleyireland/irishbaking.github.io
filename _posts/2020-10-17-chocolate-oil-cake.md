Cholocate Oil Cake. This is something that was made for my Birthday and honestly, I've only good memories attached to this cake.

I used seprate tins for this cake but if you use butter/oil to grease the sides you can use one tin and slice in half later on.

Making the ganache was not as easy as I'd hoped. Next time will deffo just use melted chocolate.

Heat the full fat cream in a bain marie.

When warm enough add the chocolate.

I coated the first cake with ganache on wire rack and then added the second cake on top.

Topped with walnuts to add some crunch.

Before adding the ganache you could cut the cake so the shape is less curvy. But, does it taste as good as it looks?
