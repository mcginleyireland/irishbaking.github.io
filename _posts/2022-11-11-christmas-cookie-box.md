    **Cookie Shortbread Pastry - Part 1**

    1. Cut butter into cubes and let sit for a couple minutes.
    2. Work the butter into the flour mixture, slowly adding more and more softened butter cubes. Best thing to do is with clean hands to squish the flour and butter together with your thumbs and fingers. Keep going till it all looks incorporated.
    3. Add the sugar and continue mixing.
    4. Add the vanilla extract and continue mixing.
    5. Add the egg yolk and continue mixing.
    6. (I accidentally added the whole egg and it still work out great) (Add more icing sugar if the mix is too wet)
    7. Knead the dough for a few minutes and make two balls of the dough.
    8. Wrap the dough balls and put it into the fridge for an hour. (This will last for longer but after maybe two days it'll be more difficult to roll out)

    **Cookie Shortbread Pastry - Part 2**

    1. Take the dough out of the fridge and leave the dough out for a minimum of 15 mins.
    2. Flour your counter and rolling pin. Roll out the dough. You'll want it to be about 2mm thick.
    3. Use a square shape cookie cutter to cut out the square shapes and have shapes holes in the middle.
    4. Then transfer to a baking tray.

    **Bake**

    1. (Optional) Crush up your Jolly Ranchers or Lolly Pops if you're not going to be using Isomalt.
    2. (Optional) Don't place the Isomalt, Jolly Ranchers or Lolly Pops in the cookie holes just yet.
    3. Bake for cookies for 7-12 mins at 160°C (320°F).
    4. If using the Isomalt, take out the cookies and add the Isomalt, Jolly Ranchers or Lolly Pops in the center of the cookies. (Remember we need empty center ones to make the box)
    5. Continue baking for another 5 minutes or less at the same temperature. (Keep an eye on them to get make sure they're all the same color)
    6. Let them cool for 5-10 mins and place them on a wire rack to cool more. The Isomalt will be difficult to remove from the baking tray straight away.

    **Construction**

    1. When the cookies are cooled down you can now add buttercream or melted chocolate to make the box.
    2.

These Christmas Cookie Boxes are the best way to share a secret suprise in them. I put in sweets but you could put in anything to them, even an engagement ring!

Roll out and shape your Cookie Box with your square shaped cut outs.

It'll be a bit messy but worth it.

Remember the Isomalt is optional. You can still make beautiful Cookie Boxes without it.

These are a lid for the boxes. But you can create any lid you like.

Once all of the pieces arecooled down, it is then time to start assembling the Cookie Boxes.

I used buttercream to stick them together, but you could use anything, even chocolate.

Any sweets will do. The more colorful the better.

Sugary sweets are the best. And jelly sweets.

I added bows to the Cookie Boxes to add a more sense of occasion. Merry Christmas.
