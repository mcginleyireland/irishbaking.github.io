    1. Add the butter and chocolate into a bain marie and melt slowly. 
    2. When they are melted, take it off the heat and leave it to one side.
    3. Mix together on high speed the egg and the sugar until well combined. 
    4. Fold in gently the now cooled butter and chocolate into the egg and sugar bowl.
    5. Fold in the sifted cocoa powder and the plain flour into the mix.

    **Bake**

Who doesn't like brownies? More fun to share but just as nice to have your own.

Always, always, always butter your ramekins before putting the batter in. Parchment paper if it's easier. (It was not easier in this case)

Sometimes its hard not to eat all of the batter!

Depending on how you like it, you might only put half the batter in and make 4.
