    **Cookie Shortbread Pastry**

    1. Cut butter into cubes and let sit for a couple minutes.
    2. Work the butter into the flour mixture, slowly adding more and more softened butter cubes. Best thing to do is with clean hands to squish the flour and butter together with your thumbs and fingers. Keep going till it all looks incorporated.
    3. Add the sugar and continue mixing.
    4. Add the vanilla extract and continue mixing.
    5. Add the egg yolk and continue mixing. (I accidentally added the whole egg and it still work out great)
    6. Knead the dough for a few minutes and make two balls of the dough.
    7. Wrap the dough balls and put it into the fridge for an hour.

    1. Leave the dough out for a minimum of 15 mins.
    2. Flour your counter and rolling pin. Roll out the dough. You want it to be about 2mm thick.
    3. Use a star shape cookie cutter to cut out the stars and transfer to a baking tray.

    **Bake**

    1. Heat oven to 160°C 120°F. Butter and flour a 12-cup Bundt pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.
    2. Bake for 10-15 mins. (Keep an eye on them to get make sure they're all the same color)
    3. Let them cool for 5-10 mins and place them on a wire rack to cool more.

    **Cookie Filling**

    1. Whisk the butter, sugar and 50g of the jam with an electric whisk.
    2. Transfer to a piping bag with a small round nozzle, or snip off the end to make a ½cm opening. Put the remaining jam in another piping bag and snip off the end to make a slightly smaller hole.
    3. Pipe blobs of the filling around the edge of each whole biscuit, leaving a space in the centre.
    4. Fill the space with jam, then sandwich a biscuit with a hole cut out on top of each one. Will keep in an airtight container for up to three days.
