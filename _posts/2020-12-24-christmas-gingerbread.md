I wanted to show that decorating gingerbread men can become a christmas tradition. I don't normally like to take short cuts, but the Choco Writers made life so much easier. Baking can be as hard as you let it be. Never taken a shortcut before?

Not every gingerbread has to be perfect. We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.
