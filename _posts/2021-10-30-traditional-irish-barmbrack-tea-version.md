    **Fruit Mix**

    1. In a mixing bowl add the fruit mix and mixed peal.
    2. Stir the mix while adding in the cooled down black tea.
    3. Add in the whiskey and mix again.
    4. Let this sit over night to let the raisins truely soak up the tea and whiskey.

    **Cake**

    1. Heat the oven to 170째C (340째F).
    2. In your mixing bowl with the fruit, tea and whiskey, mix in the sugar.
    3. Mix in the egg.
    4. Sift in the flour slowly.
    5. Add in the All Spice.
    6. When combined add the mixture to a greased and lined loaf tin.
    7. Traditionaly you can items wrapped in greaseproof paper like a ring.

    **Bake**

    1. Bake for 60 mins at 170째C (340째F).
    2. When done leave it in the tin for about 15 minutes.
    3. Then leave it on the wire rack to cool down.
    4. For best results, I'd recommend to wrap it up with greaseproof paper and then tin foil and leave it for 2 days before digging into it.
