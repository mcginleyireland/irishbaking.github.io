    2. Stir the mix while adding in the cooled down black tea.
    3. Add in the whiskey and mix again.
    4. Let this sit over night to let the raisins truely soak up the tea and whiskey.

    4. Sift in the flour slowly.
    5. Add in the All Spice.
    6. When combined add the mixture to a greased and lined loaf tin.
    7. Traditionaly you can items wrapped in greaseproof paper like a ring.

    **Bake**

    1. Bake for 60 mins at 170째C (340째F).
    2. When done leave it in the tin for about 15 minutes.
    3. Then leave it on the wire rack to cool down.

During Halloween there are two types of Barmbrack that are made. There is this one which is more fruit and more tea based. The other is less fruit and you add yeast to the mix. Both are great and we have a tradition of adding objects to the cake which I will get into below.

Brew the tea and let it cool down. We don't want the raisins to plump up too fast.

When the tea is cool add it into your fruit mix and mixed peal. I do reccommend adding some whiskey.

The next morning you add in the sugar and egg.

You'll see the mixture is still pretty wet at this stage.

Add in the flour and your spices.

When mixed well we can add it to the tin.

I normally slam the tin a few times so that there's no air bubbles stored below.

After 60 minuets you can leave it in the tin for about 15 minutes and then leave it on a wire rack after that.

There's a really great color from the tea version of Barmbrack.

Might be even the tastier of the two. Make tea and put on some butter.
