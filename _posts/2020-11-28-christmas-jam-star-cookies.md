    **Cookie Shortbread Pastry - Part 1**

    1. Cut butter into cubes and let sit for a couple minutes.
    2. Work the butter into the flour mixture, slowly adding more and more softened butter cubes. Best thing to do is with clean hands to squish the flour and butter together with your thumbs and fingers. Keep going till it all looks incorporated.
    3. Add the sugar and continue mixing.
    4. Add the vanilla extract and continue mixing.
    5. Add the egg yolk and continue mixing.
    6. (I accidentally added the whole egg and it still work out great) (Add more icing sugar if the mix is too wet)
    7. Knead the dough for a few minutes and make two balls of the dough.
    8. Wrap the dough balls and put it into the fridge for an hour. (This will last for longer but after maybe two days it'll be more difficult to roll out)

    **Cookie Shortbread Pastry - Part 2**

    1. Take the dough out of the fridge and leave the dough out for a minimum of 15 mins.
    2. Flour your counter and rolling pin. Roll out the dough. You'll want it to be about 2mm thick.
    3. Use a star shape cookie cutter to cut out the stars and transfer to a baking tray.

    **Bake**

    1. Bake for 10-15 mins at 160°C (320°F). (Keep an eye on them to get make sure they're all the same color)
    2. Let them cool for 5-10 mins and place them on a wire rack to cool more.

    **Cookie Filling**

    1. With an electric whisk, whisk the butter, sugar and 40-50g of the jam together.
    2. Adding more icing sugar if needed.
    3. Clip the end of the piping bag and add a small nozzle to it. Put the mixture into the piping bag.
    4. Get another piping bag and add the remaining jam to it. (It's ok to just wack the jam onto the cookie instead of using another pipebag)
    5. Pipe the filling around the edge of each biscuit (the ones with no hole in the middle). Fill the middle space with jam.
    6. Then press the biscuit with a star hole on top of cookie you have put filling and jam on.

The star shape cut out in the middle is going to make these cookies stand out with the jam filling.

Showing the butter cream filling near the edges. So good but if you don't want to add it you don't have to.
