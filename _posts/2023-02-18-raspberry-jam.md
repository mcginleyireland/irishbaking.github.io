    **Preperation**

    1. Sterilize the jars that you are going to be putting the jam in.
    2. Put a few plates in the fridge. We will be using a chilled plate to test if the jam is ready to be bottled.

    **Raspberry Jam**

    1. Add the raspberries to a big pot and slowly heat them up. 
    2. Add the juice of a lemon.
    3. Using a masher, mash the raspberries.
    4. Add in the sugar.
    5. Bring to a boil for 10 minues.
    6. After the 10 minutes places a bit of the jam on a chilled plate. Smudge it with your fingers. If it has wrinkles then the jam is done.
    7. If you see no wrinkles then boil for another 2 minutes, check again on the plate. Repeat untill you see wrinkles in the jam after smudging.
