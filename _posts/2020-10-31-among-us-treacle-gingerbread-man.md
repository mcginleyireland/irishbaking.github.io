    **Gingerbread Man**

    1. Heat the oven to 160째C (320째F). Grease and line a baking tray, or line the baking tray with parchment  paper.
    2. In a mixing bowl, cream the sugar, butter and treacle.
    3. Add in the egg.
    4. Add in the vanilla extract.
    5. Add in the flour gradually.
    6. Add in the bread soda. (It's ok to not have this in) (Not needed if using self-raising flour is also good to use)
    7. Add in the  ginger, cloves, allspice, and cinnamon.
    8. Divide the dough into 2. Flatten them both into disks and put them in the fridge.
    9. After an hour you can take one of the disks our.
    10. On a flat surface, sprinkly out some flour and roll out the dough to the desired shapes.
    11. When you have them on the baking try then it's time to bake.

    **Bake**

    1. Bake for 50-65 mins at 180째C (360째F).
    2. Let it cool for 10-20 mins and place it on a wire rack to cool more.

    **Royal Icing**

    1. Sift the icing sugar.
    2. Mix in one egg white at a time.
    3. Add the glycern.
    4. Prepare a small rounded piping tip in the piping bag.
    5. In a small bowl add some of the icing and add black colouring paste and mix well.
    6. Pipe out around the edges of the gingerbread and outline the lil guys visor and bag.
    7. Here's where i made my mistake, for the next part we are going to fill in the gaps with the different colors. For this we need to icing to be more runny. And to do that we have to add water to the icing.
    8. Next step is to get two shades of red. Put some icing in a different bowl and add red colouring paste.
    9. Take half of it out onto another bowl and add more red coloring paste.
    10. To make sepration between the two reds it would be better now to put one of the red icing into a piping bag and draw those lines to highlight the shading.
    11. Now we need to add water to the red icing so that it's more runny and will be flat and even on the gingerbread. (Unlike mine)
    12. When the icing looks like it will easily join back to itself then it's ready to pipe in the colours.
    13. All that is left now is to rince and repeat for the blue and white shading on the visor.

I've learned so much making these lil guys! Can't wait to make them again and impove on them! I found this gingerbread recipe really easy to roll out. It seemed sticky but in the end didn't separate at all.

I didn't have a cookie cutterer for them so had to draw and make my own.

No one ever shows the mess you make when you bake.

Really glad to get them in the oven. They also didn't grow out so they turned out great.

The second set of men I did cut a bigger gap around their legs.

This is where most of the learning came from. I learned how to make sure the icing won't be lumpy. Below I'll describe what to do to make sure they don't look as lumpy as the ones I made.

Still came out amazingly well.

Wanted to see what it would look like if I didn't do the shading. Not so bad.
