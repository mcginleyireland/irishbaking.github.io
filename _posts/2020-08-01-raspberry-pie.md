  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 2 cups, 16 oz, 260 g of all purpose flour
    * 2 teaspoons of sugar
    * 1 cup, 8 ounces, 225 g of unsalted butter cubed
    * 1 teaspoon of salt (skip if using salted butter)
    * 1/2 cup, 115 ml of full fat sour cream (not light sour cream)
    * 
    * 6 cups (about 2 1/4 pounds or 1 kilo) of fresh (or frozen) blueberries, rinsed and stems removed (if using frozen, defrost and drain first)
    * 1 teaspoon lemon zest
    * 1 Tbsp lemon juice
    * 1/4 cup (about 30g) cornstarch, all-purpose flour, or quick cooking "minute" tapioca* (for thickening)
    * 1/2 cup white granulated sugar (100g)

    1. Heat oven to 325° F. Butter and flour a 12-cup Bundt pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.
    2. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and lemon zest on medium-high until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice, then the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.
    3. Reduce mixer speed to low. Add half the flour mixture, then the yogurt, and then the remaining flour mixture. Mix just until combined (do not overmix).
    4. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for 30 minutes, then turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
    5. In a small bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar and 1 of the remaining tablespoons of lemon juice until smooth, adding the remaining lemon juice as necessary to create a thick, but pourable glaze.

If you're a sour fan you're going to love this cake. Lemon Cake is one of my favorite year-round desserts, but it is a perfect choice for spring and summer, when everyone tends to crave citrus or light & flavorful recipes

You can add extra flavour with berries.
