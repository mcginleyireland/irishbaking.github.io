    **Pastery**

    1. Cut butter into cubes and let sit for a couple minutes.
    2. Whisk together flour, salt, sugar.
    3. Work the butter into the flour mixture, slowly adding more and more softened butter cubes. Best thing to do is with clean hands to squish the flour and butter together with your thumbs and fingers. Keep going till it all looks incorporated.
    4. Add the sour cream to the flour butter mixture
    5. Form the dough into disks, wrap it and put it in the refrigerator. Here you can add flour to if needed. You'll need to leave this in the fridge for minimum an hour. Maximum a day or two.
    6. When you remove the dough from the fridge, you'll need to let it sit for 15 minutes. Maybe more. At this time I'd preheat the oven to 220°C (430°F). After 15 minutes, start rolling out the dough.
    7. After rolling the dough to your desired tickness, place the rolling pin under the dough and palce it on your tart/pie dish.
    8. Trim the edges  of the dough to 10mm (0.5 inch) over the edge of the plan. In my one I didn't do this and I think it would have been a better idea.

    **Filling**

    1. Place the strawberries, sugar, cornstarch/flour, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a large bowl. Gently stir them so that all of the strawberries are coated with some sugar and flour.
    2. Fill tart/pie dish with the berries.
    3. Roll out the second dough disk to the same size and thickness as the first. Place on top of the berry filling.
    4. I press the edges of the pastery with a fork, but what ever you were thought/learned/imagined is fine by me.

    **Egg Wash**

    1. Whisk egg and milk together to make an egg wash.
    2. Brush the top crust with egg wash.
    3. Poke your tart/pie with fork holes. (This is very important, so steam can escape while cooking).

    **Bake**

    1. Place the pie on the middle rack of the oven.
    2. Bake for 20 minutes at 220°C (430°F).
    3. Reduce heat to 180°C (360°F) and bake for 30 to 40 minutes more or until juices are bubbling and have thickened.
    4. I also placed a tray under the pie incase my oven was too hot and more of the juices came out.

Summer fruit, in a tart. What more would you want? I really loved making this.

The base of the tart. So much potential from just baking to this point.

Try not to eat all of the strawberries before putting them into the pie.

I placed them evenly for the photo but life is more hectic.

Added the sugar and cornstarch.

Added more strawberries for good luck.

Added the top of the tart to seal in the flavour. The top of the tart has an egg wash on it to make it look golden when it comes out of the oven.

The hardest part is waiting for it to cool down.
