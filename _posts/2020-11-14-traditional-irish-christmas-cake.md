    **Fruit Mix**

    1. Put all of the fruit ingerdients from the "Fruit Mix" section into a bowl.
    2. Add in the whiskey and mix slowly till all the fruit is covered in whiskey.
    3. I won't judge if you add more whiskey. (I'm known for adding more)
    4. Put cleanfilm over the bowl and leave for 24-48 hours, so that the fruit soaks up the whiskey.
    5. It's ok if it's left for a few days. (I'm also known for this too...)

    **Cake**

    1. Take the dough out of the fridge and leave the dough out for a minimum of 15 mins.
    2. Flour your counter and rolling pin. Roll out the dough. You'll want it to be about 2mm thick.
    3. Use a star shape cookie cutter to cut out the stars and transfer to a baking tray.

    **Bake**

    1. Bake for 180-240 mins at 150°C (300°F). (Mine was 180 minutes because it's not as big as a cake)
    2. When it's out of the oven, pour some more whiskey over it.
    3. I let it cool in the tin over nigth, but you take it out of the tin and let it rest.
    4. The next day wrap it up in parchment paper and tin foil.

This is one of the Christmas Recipies that has been handed down to me. It has slighly less fruit and mixture, so, it won't be as tall but that just means you can have a second slice with your cup of tea at Chrstmas.

Easy to roll and shape with your star cut outs.

The star shape cut out in the middle is going to make these Cakes stand out with the jam filling.

You can make them any sizes and just put jam on them and they still taste great!

Putting these together was so much fun.

Showing the butter cream filling near the edges. So good but if you don't want to add it you don't have to.
