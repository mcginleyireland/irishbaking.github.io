    **Fruit Mix**

    1. Put all of the fruit ingerdients from the "Fruit Mix" section into a bowl.
    2. Add in the whiskey and mix slowly till all the fruit is covered in whiskey.
    3. I won't judge if you add more whiskey. (I'm known for adding more)
    4. Put cleanfilm over the bowl and leave for 24-48 hours, so that the fruit soaks up the whiskey.
    5. It's ok if it's left for a few days. (I'm also known for this too...)

    **Cake**

    1. Take the dough out of the fridge and leave the dough out for a minimum of 15 mins.
    2. Flour your counter and rolling pin. Roll out the dough. You'll want it to be about 2mm thick.
    3. Use a star shape cookie cutter to cut out the stars and transfer to a baking tray.

    **Bake**

    1. Bake for 180-240 mins at 150°C (300°F). (Mine was 180 minutes because it's not as big as a cake)
    2. When it's out of the oven, pour some more whiskey over it.
    3. I let it cool in the tin over nigth, but you take it out of the tin and let it rest.
    4. The next day wrap it up in parchment paper and tin foil.

This is one of the Christmas Recipies that has been handed down to me. It has slighly less fruit and mixture, so, it won't be as tall but that just means you can have a second slice with your cup of tea at Chrstmas.

Bring out the fruit and get this soaking in whiskey for a day to two.

I'd rarly show photos of the lining of a tin, but this is really important for Christmas Cake.

Reason being is it's going to be in the oven for 3-4 hours so you don't want the edges to burn.

Mixing in 90% of the batter to the whiskey soaked fruits.

Placing that in the perfectly preped cake tin.

Added in the 10% of the saved batter. (So that the raisins at the top don't burn)

When it comes out of the oven it's best to pour some more whiskey over it!
