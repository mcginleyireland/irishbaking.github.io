    1. Heat oven to 180° C. Butter and flour a 12-cup Bundt pan. In a medium bowl, cream the sugar and butter.
    2. Add the eggs, lemon rind, flour and milk together and beat until combined. Scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.
    3. Reduce mixer speed to low. Add half the flour mixture, then the yogurt, and then the remaining flour mixture. Mix just until combined (do not overmix).
    4. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for 30 minutes, then turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
    5. In a small bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar and 1 of the remaining tablespoons of lemon juice until smooth, adding the remaining lemon juice as necessary to create a thick, but pourable glaze.

If you're a sour fan you're going to love this cake. Lemon Drizzle is one of my favorite year-round desserts, but it is a perfect choice for spring and summer, when everyone tends to crave citrus or light & flavorful recipes

It's always important to butter your tins, but I find these loaf paper linings do the job.

While your cake is in the oven prepare the lemon drizzle part of the Lemon Drizzle Cake.

While still in the pan drizzle over the lemon and icing sugar mix. You can poke fork holes in the cake to bring a rich lemon flavour to all part of the cake.
