If you're a sour fan you're going to love this cake. Lemon Drizzle is one of my favorite year-round desserts, but it is a perfect choice for spring and summer, when everyone tends to crave citrus or light & flavorful recipes

It's always important to butter your tins, but I find these loaf paper linings do the job.

While your cake is in the oven prepare the lemon drizzle part of the Lemon Drizzle Cake.

While still in the pan drizzle over the lemon and icing sugar mix. You can poke fork holes in the cake to bring a rich lemon flavour to all part of the cake.
