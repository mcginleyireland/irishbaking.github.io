    **Brownie Part**

    1. Add the butter and chocolate into a bain marie and melt slowly. 
    2. When they are melted, take it off the heat and leave it to one side.
    3. Mix together on high speed the egg and the sugar until well combined. 
    4. Fold in gently the now cooled butter and chocolate into the egg and sugar bowl.
    5. Fold in the sifted cocoa powder and the plain flour into the mix.
    6. Add the mixture to your buttered ramekins.

    **Brownie Part - Bake**

    1. Bake for 20-30 mins at 180°C (360°F).
    2. Once out of the oven, leave in the ramekin until cooled. (Believe me... it will fall apart!)

    **Buttery Biscuit Base Part**

    1. Crush up the biscuits in a food processor or by hand.
    2. Add in melted butter. (add more if needed)
    3. When mixed well add the mixture to the containers and flatten down.
    4. (Optional) Top this melted chocolate. (Melt in microwave or by a bain marie)
    5. Let the chocolate set slightly and add the baked and cooled brownie on top.

    **Cheesecake Part**

    1. In a separate bowl, add the cream cheese and icing sugar, vanilla extract and lemon juice.
    2. Whisk the mixture until smooth.
    3. Next I popped my mixutre into a piping bag to pipe into the crevices of the dish. Also, a chopstick helped me get into the hidden crevices.
    4. Once you have all of the mixture used you should have 4 delicious Brownie Cheese Cakes! Exjoy!

This is my favourite desert. It combinds two of my favourite deserts. With a star dish it makes presentation so easy!

It's all about that buttery biscuit base!

Not needed but if I can sneak in chocolate in a recipe I will! Also, will seel in the buttery biscuit base so that no cheese cake will seep into the bottom.
