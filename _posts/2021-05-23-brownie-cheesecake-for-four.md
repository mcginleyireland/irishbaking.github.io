This is my favourite desert. It combinds two of my favourite deserts. With a star dish it makes presentation so easy!

It's all about that buttery biscuit base!

Not needed but if I can sneak in chocolate in a recipe I will! Also, will seel in the buttery biscuit base so that no cheese cake will seep into the bottom.
