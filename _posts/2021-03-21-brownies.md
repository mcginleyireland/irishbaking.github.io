Who doesn't like brownies? More fun to share but just as nice to have your own.

Always, always, always butter your dish before putting the batter in. Parchment paper if it's easier. (It was not easier in this case)

Sometimes its hard not to eat all of the batter!

Depending on how you like it, you might only put half the batter in and make 4.
