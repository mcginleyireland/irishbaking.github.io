    **Pancake Batter**

    1. (Optional) The first thing I do is separate the egg whites from the egg yoke and then beat the egg whites with an electric whisk until I have stiff white peaks. 
    2. In a mixing bowl sift the flour.
    3. Add in the eggs and mix.
    4. Slowly and in the milk and mix every time you add in a bit.

    **Frying the Pancakes**

    5. Some people like to fry the pancakes in butter but I like to use Olive Oil. (Probably not the healthiest)
    6. When the oil/butter is hot enouh on the frying pan, add some of the pancake batter.
    7. When the top side is no longer wet, flip it over.

I was a little bit late posting this, but Pancake Tuesday is my favourite day of the year. This is the way my Mam makes it and it's such a reminder of my childhood when I make it this way.

If it's seeping out too much in the oven, take it out.
