I think in lockdown the hardest thing to do is to share your baking. Which means you eat all of the cake yourself. So, here is a recipe for just one. Banana Crumble. Hope you enjoy.

If it's seeping out too much in the oven, take it out.

The brownies need to rest and be cooled before the meringue goes on top.

You can put on a second brownie on top if you'd like to have a sharing desert as a couple.
