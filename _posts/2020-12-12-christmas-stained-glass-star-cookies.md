    **Cookie Shortbread Pastry - Part 1**

    1. Cut butter into cubes and let sit for a couple minutes.
    2. Work the butter into the flour mixture, slowly adding more and more softened butter cubes. Best thing to do is with clean hands to squish the flour and butter together with your thumbs and fingers. Keep going till it all looks incorporated.
    3. Add the sugar and continue mixing.
    4. Add the vanilla extract and continue mixing.
    5. Add the egg yolk and continue mixing. (I accidentally added the whole egg and it still work out great)
    6. Knead the dough for a few minutes and make two balls of the dough.
    7. Wrap the dough balls and put it into the fridge for an hour. (This will last for longer but after maybe two days it'll be more difficult to roll out)

    **Cookie Shortbread Pastry - Part 2**

    1. Take the dough out of the fridge and leave the dough out for a minimum of 15 mins.
    2. Flour your counter and rolling pin. Roll out the dough. You'll want it to be about 2mm thick.
    3. Use a star shape cookie cutter to cut out the star shapes and have star shaped holes in the middle.
    4. With a staw, pierce a hole in one of the stars, so that you can put string through it later.
    4. Then transfer to a baking tray.

    **Bake**

    1. Crush up your Jolly Ranchers or Lolly Pops if you're not going to be using Isomalt.
    2. Don't place the Isomalt, Jolly Ranchers or Lolly Pops in the cookie holes just yet.
    3. Bake for cookies for 7-12 mins at 160°C (320°F). (Keep an eye on them to get make sure they're all the same color)
    4. Take out the cookies and add the Isomalt, Jolly Ranchers or Lolly Pops in the center of the cookies.
    5. Bake for another 3 minutes or less at the same temperature.	
    6. Let them cool for 5-10 mins and place them on a wire rack to cool more. The Isomalt will be difficult to remove from the baking tray straight away.

This was a failure, I added the balls at the start and it seemed to gel into the cookie.

Putting the balls in 5 minutes before the end.

Putting the balls in 3 minutes before the end.

Putting the balls in 5 minutes before the end didn't work out as well.

Putting the balls in 3 minutes before the end worked out way better.
