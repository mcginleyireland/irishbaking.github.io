It's always important to butter your tins, but I find these loaf paper linings way better.

While your cake is in the oven prepare the lemon drizzle part of the Lemon Drizzle Cake.

While still in the tin drizzle over the lemon and icing sugar mix. You can poke fork holes in the cake to bring a rich lemon flavour to all part of the cake.
